# Egypt Tourism Chatbot: Complete Database Migration Plan

## Overview

This comprehensive migration plan transforms the current Egypt Tourism Chatbot database schema into a best-practice PostgreSQL implementation based on thorough analysis of the actual database state, codebase patterns, and performance measurements. The plan is structured into logical, sequential phases with clear validation steps and rollback procedures.

## Current Environment Assessment

Based on detailed analysis of the database environment:

**PostgreSQL Environment**:

- PostgreSQL version: 14.17
- Extensions:
  - postgis version 3.5.2 ✅
  - vector version 0.8.0 ✅ (supports HNSW indexes)

**Redis Implementation Issues**:

- Multiple Redis client implementations exist in the codebase:
  - src/session/redis_manager.py (main implementation)
  - src/services/redis_client.py (async implementation)
  - src/auth/session.py (direct connection)
- Redis connection settings are defined in multiple places:
  - src/utils/settings.py
  - src/config/fastapi_config.py
  - src/config.py
- Missing method errors in logs: RedisSessionManager is missing save_session() and get_context() methods

**Reference Integrity Issues**:

- The attraction "bibliotheca_alexandrina" has type "cultural" which doesn't exist in the attraction_types table (should be "cultural_center")
- Both accommodations have type "luxury" which doesn't exist in the accommodation_types table (should be "luxury_hotel")

**Data Volume Assessment**:

- Database has very little data (4 attractions, 2 accommodations, 4 cities)
- JSONB fields are completely unpopulated (0 count), while text fields are populated

**Missing Infrastructure Components**:

- No migration framework (like Alembic) is being used
- No database backup/restore tools are explicitly configured

## 0. Pre-Migration Preparation

### 0.1 Fix Redis Session Management Issues ✅

**Critical Issue**: Redis session errors must be addressed before schema changes.

**Instructions**:

1. Locate the RedisSessionManager class in src/session/redis_manager.py (not src/auth/session.py as previously thought)
2. Implement the missing methods that src/chatbot.py expects:

   ```python
   def save_session(self, session_id: str, session_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
       """Alias for store_session for compatibility."""
       return self.store_session(session_id, session_data)

   def get_context(self, session_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """Get context data from session."""
       session = self.get_session(session_id)
       if not session:
           return {}
       return session.get("context", {})
   ```

3. Standardize Redis connection handling across the codebase:
   - Consolidate connection settings in src/utils/settings.py
   - Update references in src/config/fastapi_config.py and src/config.py
4. Add proper error handling for Redis connection failures

**Validation**:

1. Create a test script that verifies Redis connection and performs basic session operations
2. Check application logs to confirm absence of Redis-related errors
3. Verify session persistence across application restarts

### 0.2 Set Up Monitoring and Logging ✅

**Instructions**:

1. Enhance the execute_postgres_query method in src/knowledge/database.py to log:
   - Query execution time
   - Parameter values for slow queries (>100ms)
   - Query ID for correlation
2. Add slow query logging to src/utils/postgres_database.py with a threshold of 100ms
3. Implement performance monitoring for vector search operations in src/knowledge/vector_db.py
4. Add API-level timing in src/routes/knowledge_base.py
5. Set up cache monitoring in src/knowledge/vector_cache.py

**Validation**:

1. Execute common queries and verify logging output
2. Check log format and content for actionable information
3. Ensure sensitive data is not logged

## 1. Database Analysis and Documentation

   ```
2. Verify backup integrity:
   ```sql
   -- Test restore in a temporary database
   createdb egypt_chatbot_test
   pg_restore -U postgres -d egypt_chatbot_test egypt_chatbot_pre_migration_*.dump
   ```
3. Store backup in a secure location

   - \dx (List installed extensions)
   - \di (List all indexes)
2. Document table relationships, constraints, and indexes
3. Analyze data distribution and record row counts for each table
4. Record the actual schema structure of key tables (attractions, accommodations, cities)

**Validation**:

1. Verify that all tables, indexes, and extensions are documented
2. Confirm accuracy of relationship documentation
3. Ensure all schema inconsistencies are noted

### 1.2 Create Test Environment ✅

**Instructions**:

1. Create a migration test database:
