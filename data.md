# Egypt Tourism Data Enhancement Plan

## Phase 1: Data Assessment

### 1.1 Directory Structure Analysis
1. Identify all existing directories and subdirectories
2. Map the hierarchy and organization logic
3. Identify inconsistencies in the directory structure
   - Files in root that should be in subdirectories
   - Inconsistent naming conventions
   - Redundant directories or files
4. Compare against best practices for tourism data organization

### 1.2 Schema Validation
1. Extract schemas from the `schemas` directory
2. Validate all JSON files against their respective schemas
3. Identify files missing required fields
4. Check for type inconsistencies (strings, numbers, arrays, objects)
5. Detect schema violations or inconsistencies

### 1.3 Data Completeness Evaluation
1. Check each attraction, city, and accommodation for:
   - Missing descriptions
   - Incomplete practical information
   - Missing multilingual content (especially Arabic)
   - Broken cross-references to other entities
   - Outdated information
2. Create a completeness score for each file
3. Prioritize files for enhancement based on completeness scores

### 1.4 Cross-Reference Integrity
1. Validate all IDs referenced in "nearby_attractions" and similar fields
2. Ensure bidirectional references (if A references B, B should reference A)
3. Check for orphaned references (references to non-existent entities)
4. Verify geographic consistency of references

## Phase 2: Standardization

### 2.1 Directory Restructuring
1. Implement a consistent directory structure:
   ```
   data/
   ├── attractions/
   │   ├── historical/

   │   ├── religious/
   │   ├── modern/
   │   └── shopping/
   ├── cities/
   ├── regions/
   ├── accommodations/
   ├── restaurants/
   ├── transportation/
   ├── tours/
   ├── activities/
   ├── practical_info/
