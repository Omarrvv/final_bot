# Database Refactoring Documentation

This document describes the database refactoring approach for the Egypt Tourism Chatbot.

## Overview

The database layer has been refactored to improve maintainability, testability, and performance. The refactoring follows a hybrid approach that addresses immediate critical issues while working toward a comprehensive architectural improvement.

## Architecture

The new architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Database Core**: Handles connection pooling and query execution
2. **Repositories**: Handle entity-specific database operations
3. **Transaction Manager**: Handles database transactions
4. **Database Factory**: Creates and manages database components
5. **Database Manager**: Provides backward compatibility with the old interface

### Components

#### Database Core

The `DatabaseCore` class provides core database functionality including connection pooling, query execution, and transaction management. It serves as the foundation for the database access layer.

Key features:
- Connection pooling with optimized settings
- Query execution with error handling
- Connection acquisition metrics tracking
- Proper connection cleanup

#### Base Repository

The `BaseRepository` class provides common database operations that can be used by specific repository classes. It handles error handling, JSON parsing, and other common operations.

Key features:
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- JSON field parsing
- Error handling
- Search functionality

#### Entity Repositories

Entity-specific repositories extend the `BaseRepository` class to provide entity-specific database operations. For example, the `AttractionRepository` class provides attraction-specific operations.

Key features:
- Entity-specific queries
- Business logic related to the entity
- Specialized search methods

#### Transaction Manager

The `TransactionManager` class provides a context manager for database transactions, ensuring proper commit and rollback behavior.

Key features:
- Transaction context manager
- Function execution within a transaction
- Decorator for atomic operations

#### Database Factory

The `DatabaseFactory` class provides a factory for creating database components such as repositories and services.

Key features:
- Singleton instances of repositories and services
- Centralized component creation
- Resource management

#### Database Manager

The `DatabaseManager` class provides backward compatibility with the old interface while using the new components internally.

Key features:
- Same interface as the old `DatabaseManager`
- Uses the new components internally
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Migration Plan

The migration to the new architecture follows a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes

1. Fix connection pool management
   - Implement consistent use of try-finally blocks
   - Add connection validation before use
   - Ensure connections are always returned to the pool

2. Address SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Review and fix dynamic query construction
   - Implement proper parameter binding
   - Add input validation for table names and column references

3. Improve error handling
   - Standardize error handling for database operations
   - Implement appropriate logging
   - Add retry logic for transient failures

### Phase 2: Modular Refactoring

1. Create Core Database Module
   - Extract connection pooling and query execution
   - Implement transaction management with context managers

2. Create Base Repository and Entity Repositories
   - Implement base repository with common operations
   - Create entity-specific repositories

3. Create Transaction Manager
   - Implement transaction context manager
   - Add support for atomic operations

4. Create Database Factory
   - Implement factory for creating database components
   - Add support for singleton instances

5. Update Database Manager
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Use new components internally

### Phase 3: Complete the Refactoring

1. Finish implementing all repositories and services
2. Create comprehensive tests
3. Implement database migration strategy
4. Enhance monitoring and metrics

## Testing

The refactoring includes comprehensive tests to ensure that the new implementation works correctly and maintains backward compatibility.

Test cases:
- `TestDatabaseCore`: Tests for the `DatabaseCore` class
- `TestBaseRepository`: Tests for the `BaseRepository` class
- `TestAttractionRepository`: Tests for the `AttractionRepository` class
- `TestDatabaseManager`: Tests for the `DatabaseManager` class

## Migration Script

A migration script is provided to help with the transition from the old architecture to the new one. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Create a backup of the old database files
2. Run tests to verify the new implementation
3. Update imports in the codebase to use the new implementation
4. Rename files according to the provided mappings

Usage:
```bash
python scripts/migrate_to_new_db_architecture.py
```

Options:
- `--backup-only`: Only create backup, don't make changes
- `--skip-tests`: Skip running tests
- `--skip-backup`: Skip creating backup

## Benefits

The refactoring provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Maintainability**: The code is more modular and follows SOLID principles
2. **Better Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Enhanced Performance**: Connection pooling and query execution are optimized
4. **Reduced Technical Debt**: The code is more maintainable and follows best practices
5. **Backward Compatibility**: The old interface is maintained for compatibility

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to consider:

1. Implement more entity repositories
2. Add more comprehensive tests
3. Enhance monitoring and metrics
4. Implement database migration strategy
5. Add support for database sharding
6. Implement connection pooling optimizations
7. Add support for read replicas
