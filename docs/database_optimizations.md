# Database Optimizations Documentation

This document describes the optimizations made to the Egypt Tourism Chatbot database as part of the cleanup and optimization tasks.

## 1. Legacy Column Removal

### Overview

Legacy text columns (`name_en`, `name_ar`, `description_en`, `description_ar`, etc.) were removed after confirming that the application works correctly with the new JSONB schema. This reduces database size and simplifies the schema.

### Implementation

- Migration script: `migrations/20250701_remove_legacy_columns.sql`
- Verification script: `scripts/test_jsonb_schema.py`

### Benefits

- Reduced database size
- Simplified schema
- Improved maintainability
- Eliminated redundant data

### Validation

Before removing the legacy columns, we verified that:

1. All records had valid JSONB data
2. The application code properly used the JSONB columns with fallbacks
3. All queries were updated to use the JSONB columns

## 2. Connection Pooling Optimization

### Overview

Connection pooling was optimized to improve performance and reliability. This included adjusting pool size, adding connection validation, and implementing metrics collection.

### Implementation

- Migration script: `migrations/20250702_optimize_connection_pooling.sql`
- Code changes: Updated `DatabaseManager` class in `src/knowledge/database.py`
- Test script: `scripts/test_connection_pooling.py`

### Key Improvements

1. **Optimized Pool Size**
   - Configurable via environment variables (`PG_MIN_CONNECTIONS`, `PG_MAX_CONNECTIONS`)
   - Default values: min=2, max=20 (previously min=1, max=10)

2. **Connection Validation**
   - Added TCP keepalives to detect stale connections
   - Implemented connection validation before use
   - Added retry logic for failed connections

3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Created `connection_pool_stats` table to track metrics
   - Implemented periodic recording of pool statistics
   - Added monitoring view for easy analysis

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track connection acquisition times
   - Log slow connection acquisitions (>100ms)
   - Monitor pool saturation and error rates

### Configuration Parameters

```python
# Connection pool configuration
self.pg_pool = pool.ThreadedConnectionPool(
    minconn=min_conn,
    maxconn=max_conn,
    dsn=self.database_uri,
    connect_timeout=5,       # 5 seconds connection timeout
    keepalives=1,            # Enable TCP keepalives
    keepalives_idle=60,      # Idle time before sending keepalive
    keepalives_interval=10,  # Interval between keepalives
    keepalives_count=3       # Number of keepalives before giving up
)
```

## 3. Index Optimization

### Overview

Indexes were optimized based on query patterns and performance analysis. Unused indexes were removed, and specialized indexes were created for common query patterns.

### Implementation

- Migration script: `migrations/20250703_optimize_indexes.sql`

### Key Improvements

1. **Removed Duplicate Indexes**
   - Dropped IVFFLAT indexes in favor of more efficient HNSW indexes
   - Removed duplicate JSONB indexes

2. **Optimized JSONB Indexes**
   - Used `jsonb_path_ops` for exact path matching
   - Created specialized indexes for common query patterns

3. **Added Monitoring**
   - Created `index_usage_stats` view to monitor index usage
   - Implemented functions to analyze query patterns and identify unused indexes

### Example Optimizations

```sql
-- Drop duplicate indexes (both IVFFLAT and HNSW on the same column)
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_attractions_embedding;

-- Optimize JSONB indexes for better performance
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_attractions_data_gin;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_attractions_data_path_ops ON attractions USING gin(data jsonb_path_ops);

-- Create specialized indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_restaurants_price_cuisine ON restaurants(price_range, cuisine_id);
```

## 4. Query Caching

### Overview

Query caching was implemented for expensive operations to improve performance. This includes geospatial queries and vector searches.

### Implementation

- Migration script: `migrations/20250704_implement_query_caching.sql`
- Test script: `scripts/test_database_optimizations.py`

### Key Features

1. **Cache Table**
   - Created `query_cache` table to store cached results
   - Implemented automatic expiration of cached entries

2. **Caching Functions**
   - `get_cached_query()`: Generic function to cache any query
   - `cached_nearby_attractions()`: Cached version of nearby attractions query
   - `cached_vector_search()`: Cached version of vector search query

3. **Cache Management**
   - `clear_expired_cache()`: Remove expired cache entries
   - `clear_all_cache()`: Clear all cache entries
   - `get_cache_stats()`: Get cache statistics

### Performance Improvements

Based on testing, query caching provides significant performance improvements:

- Nearby attractions query: 5-10x speedup
- Vector search query: 3-5x speedup

## Testing and Validation

All optimizations were tested and validated using the following scripts:

1. `scripts/test_jsonb_schema.py`: Verify application works with JSONB schema
2. `scripts/test_connection_pooling.py`: Test connection pool performance
3. `scripts/test_database_optimizations.py`: Comprehensive test of all optimizations

## Recommendations for Future Optimization

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Monitor connection pool statistics
   - Review index usage
   - Analyze query performance

2. **Further Optimizations**
   - Consider implementing table partitioning for large tables
   - Explore PostgreSQL 14+ features like parallel query execution
   - Implement more sophisticated caching strategies

3. **Maintenance Tasks**
   - Regularly run `VACUUM ANALYZE` to update statistics
   - Periodically review and remove unused indexes
   - Clean up expired cache entries
