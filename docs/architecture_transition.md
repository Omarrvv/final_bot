# Architecture Transition Plan

## Current State

The Egypt Tourism Chatbot now uses a consolidated FastAPI architecture:

1. ~~**Legacy Path**: Root-level `main.py` imports and runs the application from `src/app.py`~~
2. **Current Architecture**: The application exclusively uses `src/main.py` as the entry point

The previous dual-path approach has been resolved, eliminating:

- Duplicate middleware registration
- Inconsistent API behavior
- Maintenance burden of keeping multiple files in sync
- Confusion for developers about the active execution path

## Transition Plan

### Phase 1: Middleware Alignment (Completed)

- [x] Fix middleware order in both `src/app.py` and `src/main.py`
- [x] Ensure request logging middleware is added before CORS middleware in both files

### Phase 2: Entry Point Consolidation (Completed)

1. [x] Modify root-level `main.py` to use `src/main.py` instead of `src/app.py`
2. [x] Update any remaining scripts or documentation referring to `src/app.py`
3. [x] Ensure all routes defined in `src/app.py` have counterparts in `src/main.py` or its routers
4. [x] Verify all middleware and dependencies are properly configured in `src/main.py`
5. [x] Test both entry points to ensure identical behavior before final cutover

### Phase 3: Decommissioning Legacy Code (Completed)

1. [x] Temporarily rename `src/app.py` to `src/app.py.bak` to verify nothing breaks
2. [x] Update documentation to reference only `src/main.py`
3. [x] Remove references to `src/app.py` from all configuration files
4. [x] Archive or remove `src/app.py` once stability is confirmed
5. [x] Remove Flask dependencies from requirements.txt
6. [x] Uninstall Flask packages from the environment

## Testing Checklist

All verification tests have been successfully completed:

- [x] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [x] Middleware stack processes requests in the correct order
- [x] Error handling works as expected
- [x] Authentication and authorization function properly
- [x] Session management operates correctly
- [x] Database connections are established and queries execute
- [x] The application starts up correctly using only `src/main.py`

## Completion Criteria

The transition is now complete:

1. [x] The application runs reliably using only `src/main.py` as the entry point
2. [x] All integration tests pass
3. [x] `src/app.py` has been removed from the codebase
4. [x] Documentation is updated to reference only the new architecture

## Next Steps

The project is now ready to proceed to the next phase of development:

- Database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL (Phase 3 in the project plan)
- RAG Pipeline implementation
- Advanced NLU and Dialog features
