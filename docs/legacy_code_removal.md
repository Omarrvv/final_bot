# Legacy Code Removal

This document summarizes the changes made to remove legacy code from the Egypt Tourism Chatbot codebase.

## Overview

As part of the repair plan (task 4.3), we removed legacy code from the codebase, including:

1. Flask/SQLite remnants
2. Unused frontend files
3. Dead code and unused imports

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Flask/SQLite Remnants

#### Environment Variables

- Removed `FLASK_ENV` and `FLASK_DEBUG` from `.env.example`
- Updated Kubernetes deployment files to use FastAPI-specific environment variables:
  - Changed `FLASK_APP` to `API_PORT`
  - Changed `FLASK_ENV` to `ENV`
  - Updated port references from `5000` to `5050`

#### Deprecated Files

- Removed `src/utils/database.py.deprecated` which contained SQLite-specific code

### 2. Deleted Unused Frontend Files

- Removed the entire `src/frontend` directory, which contained:
  - Static CSS, JS, and image files
  - HTML templates
  - Test files
  - This directory was obsolete as the project now uses a React frontend in the `react-frontend` directory

### 3. Removed Dead Code and Unused Imports

- Removed commented-out code in `src/main.py`:
  - Removed references to the protected router
  - Cleaned up duplicate comments

## Deprecated Files

The following files have been marked as deprecated but not removed yet:

1. `src/services/session.py` - Legacy session service
2. `src/auth/session.py` - Legacy session management module
3. `src/session/factory.py` - Legacy session factory

These files have been marked with deprecation warnings and will be removed in a future update once all dependencies have been migrated to the new unified session management approach.

## Testing

After making these changes, we verified that the application still works correctly by:

1. Running the application
2. Checking that the API endpoints are accessible
3. Verifying that the React frontend is served correctly

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration away from the deprecated session management code
2. Remove the deprecated files once all dependencies have been migrated
3. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
