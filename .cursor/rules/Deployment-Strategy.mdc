# Deployment Strategy

## Current Deployment Architecture

The Egypt Tourism Chatbot has a defined but possibly incomplete deployment strategy:

- **Containerization**: Docker with Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manifests in k8s/ directory
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows defined but tests failing
- **Environment**: Configuration via .env file

## Target Deployment Architecture

The ideal deployment architecture consists of:

### Components

1. **Application Tier**:
   - FastAPI service for API endpoints
   - Horizontally scalable
   - Stateless design with external session storage

2. **Database Tier**:
   - PostgreSQL with PostGIS and pgvector
   - Proper backup strategy
   - Connection pooling

3. **Cache Tier**:
   - Redis for session storage and caching
   - Persistent volume for data durability

4. **Frontend**:
   - Hosted static files (React build)
   - CDN for delivery

### Infrastructure

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Multiple nodes for high availability
   - Autoscaling for variable load
   - Resource limits and requests

2. **Networking**:
   - Ingress controller with TLS
   - Service mesh for internal communication
   - Network policies for security

3. **Observability**:
   - Prometheus for metrics
   - Grafana for dashboards
   - Centralized logging
   - Distributed tracing

## Deployment Process

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Run tests on pull requests
   - Lint code and check formatting
   - Security scanning (dependencies, SAST)
   - Build Docker images

2. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - Automated deployment to staging environment
   - Integration tests in staging
   - Manual approval for production
   - Canary deployments

### Environment Configuration

- Environment-specific configuration via Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Database migrations as part of deployment

## Scaling Strategy

- Horizontal scaling of API services
- Database read replicas for scaling read operations
- Redis cluster for distributed caching
- CDN for static content delivery

## Disaster Recovery

- Regular database backups
- Multi-region deployment capability
- Automated recovery procedures
- Chaos engineering practices

## Security Considerations

- Secrets management via Kubernetes Secrets
- Network isolation with proper segmentation
- Regular security scanning
- Minimal container permissions
