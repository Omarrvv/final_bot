# Multilingual Requirements

## Overview

The Egypt Tourism Chatbot requires robust multilingual support with a specific focus on English (EN) and Arabic (AR).

## Core Multilingual Components

### 1. Data Structure Requirements

The knowledge base data consistently includes parallel language structures for both English and Arabic:
- Names, descriptions, and highlights in both languages
- Language-specific formatting and presentation
- Cultural adaptations beyond literal translation

### 2. NLU (Natural Language Understanding)

The NLU Engine must support both languages with:
- Language detection capabilities
- Language-specific models for intent recognition
- Cross-lingual entity extraction
- Arabic-specific text preprocessing
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for both languages

**Arabic NLP Considerations**:
- Word segmentation differences
- Diacritics handling
- Normalization of Arabic text
- Stemming for Arabic words
- Handling of Arabic dialects (Egyptian dialect specifics)

### 3. Dialog Management

Key requirements:
- Language-aware dialog flows
- Cultural adaptation of conversation patterns
- Language parameter persistence throughout session
- Ability to switch languages mid-conversation
- Culture-specific dialog strategies

### 4. Response Generation

Key requirements:
- Language-specific response templates
- Cultural adaptation of content
- RTL text handling for Arabic
- Language-specific formatting rules
- Numerical and date format localization

### 5. UI/Frontend Requirements

Key requirements:
- Language toggle functionality
- RTL layout support for Arabic
- Bidirectional (Bidi) text handling
- Font support for Arabic script
- Localized UI elements
- Proper text alignment and direction

### 6. Knowledge Base Queries

Key requirements:
- Language parameter in all KB queries
- Entity resolution across languages
- Consistent response structure with language-specific content
- Cross-lingual search capabilities

## Cultural Adaptation

Beyond language translation, cultural adaptation includes:

1. **Appropriate Greetings**: Different greeting styles based on time of day and formality level
2. **Cultural References**: Proper use of Egyptian cultural references and historical context
3. **Honorifics and Formality**: Maintaining proper formality levels in Arabic
4. **Local Knowledge**: Providing culturally appropriate information about customs, etiquette, and practices
5. **Religious Context**: Sensitivity to religious sites, practices, and terminology

## Interface Contracts

All internal API interfaces must consistently support the language parameter throughout the system.
