# Detailed Changelog: Egypt Tourism Chatbot Refactoring

_As of: [Date of generation]_

This document logs the significant actions, changes, and decisions made during the refactoring process based on the conversation history.

## Environment & Dependencies

- **New Conda Environment:** Created `egypt-tourism1` using `environment.yml` and `conda env create` to isolate project dependencies.
- **Dependency Installation:** Installed base dependencies from `requirements.txt` into `egypt-tourism1` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **`typer` Conflict Resolution:**
  - Identified conflict between `spacy` (requiring `typer<0.10.0`) and `fastapi-cli` (requiring `typer>=0.12.3`).
  - Removed the explicit `typer==0.9.4` pin from `requirements.txt` to allow `pip` to resolve the conflict in favor of `fastapi-cli`'s requirement.
- **Testing Dependencies Installed:** Added `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `httpx`, `pytest-cov` to the `egypt-tourism1` environment using `pip install`.
- **NLU Dependency Installed:** Added `fasttext-wheel` to the `egypt-tourism1` environment using `pip install` to satisfy requirements for `src/nlu/language.py`.
- **`torch` Vulnerability Check:**
  - Investigated `pip-audit` findings related to `torch==2.2.2`.
  - Identified the relevant vulnerability (`CVE-2024-5480` / `GHSA-7rxh-xq45-8wr4`) affecting `torch.distributed.rpc` in versions _prior_ to 2.2.2.
  - Verified that the codebase does not use `torch.distributed.rpc`.
  - Decision made to **defer** upgrading `torch` to maintain stability with related ML packages.
- **IDE Environment Activation:** Configured Cursor/VS Code to automatically activate the `egypt-tourism1` environment for terminals opened within the workspace by selecting the correct Python interpreter (`/opt/miniconda3/envs/egypt-tourism1/bin/python`).
- **`direnv` Troubleshooting:** Attempted to use `direnv` with an `.envrc` file for automatic activation in any terminal. Encountered persistent `layout_conda: command not found` errors despite `.zshrc` order adjustments and sourcing `conda.sh`. **Abandoned `direnv` approach** in favor of IDE activation and manual activation.
- **`.envrc` Cleanup:** Removed the `.envrc` file to stop `direnv` errors.

## Knowledge Base Implementation (Phase 3)

- **Population Script:** Created `scripts/populate_kb.py`.
  - Script connects to `data/egypt_chatbot.db`.
  - Parses JSON files from `data/attractions/`, `data/restaurants/`, `data/accommodations/`.
  - Inserts/replaces data into corresponding SQLite tables, handling nested fields via a `data` JSON column.
  - Script was successfully executed, populating the database.
- **`KnowledgeBase` Refactoring:** Modified `src/knowledge/knowledge_base.py`.
  - Removed placeholder/mock data and logic.
  - Ensured `__init__` accepts the injected `DatabaseManager`.
  - Implemented methods (`get_attraction_by_id`, `search_attractions`, `search_restaurants`, `search_hotels`, `get_restaurant_by_id`, `get_hotel_by_id`) to delegate calls to the corresponding `DatabaseManager` methods (`get_attraction`, `search_attractions`, `search_restaurants`, `search_accommodations`, `get_restaurant`, `get_accommodation`).
  - Retained query/filter translation logic within the search methods before passing to the `DatabaseManager`.

## API Refactoring (FastAPI Migration - Phase 4)

- **Analytics API:** Refactored `src/api/analytics_api.py`.
  - Converted from Flask Blueprint to FastAPI `APIRouter`.
  - Updated imports, route decorators (`@analytics_router.get(...)`), and function signatures (`async def`).
  - Added FastAPI dependency injection for authentication (`Depends(get_current_admin_user)`, `Depends(get_current_active_user)`).
  - Used `HTTPException` for errors.
- **Main App Integration:** Included the `analytics_router` in the main FastAPI application in `src/main.py` using `app.include_router(analytics_router)`.

## Testing (Phase 4)

- **Initial `KnowledgeBase` Unit Tests:** Added `tests/unit/knowledge/test_knowledge_base.py`.
  - Used `pytest` fixtures and `unittest.mock.Mock` to create a mock `DatabaseManager`.
  - Tested `KnowledgeBase` initialization.
  - Tested delegation of `get_attraction_by_id` to the mock DB manager.
  - Tested delegation of `search_attractions` (with and without query text) to the mock DB manager, verifying the constructed query dictionary.

## Services (Phase 3)

- **`WeatherService` Verification:** Reviewed `src/integration/plugins/weather_service.py`.
  - Confirmed it checks for an `api_key` in config.
  - Confirmed it falls back gracefully to providing mock data using `_get_mock_weather()` if the key is missing.
  - Marked Phase 3, Action 4 as functionally verified (pending addition of a real API key for live data).
