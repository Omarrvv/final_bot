# Backup Columns Removal

## Overview

This document describes the removal of redundant backup columns from the database schema.

## Background

During the migration to JSONB and vector types, backup columns were created to preserve the original data in case the migration failed. These columns were:

- `name_backup`
- `description_backup`
- `embedding_backup`

These columns were present in the following tables:

- `accommodations`
- `attractions`
- `cities`
- `restaurants`

## Verification

Before removing the backup columns, we verified that the data in the main columns matched the data in the backup columns. The verification script (`scripts/verify_backup_columns.py`) confirmed that all backup columns matched their corresponding main columns.

## Migration

The backup columns were removed using the migration script `migrations/20250710_remove_backup_columns.sql`. The migration was executed on May 13, 2025.

## Rollback

If needed, the backup columns can be restored from the database backup `egypt_chatbot_backup_before_removing_backup_columns.sql` created before the migration.

## Impact

The removal of the backup columns has no impact on the application code, as these columns were not used in the application. The removal only affects the database schema, reducing the size of the database and improving query performance.
